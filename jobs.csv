San Francisco, CA.

The Role

Pilot is a successful startup hiring a senior engineer for our SMB Product teams.

All of our teams have unique charters to collectively build the software, services and systems that enable Pilot to deliver a high-quality experience, profitably, at scale. The SMB Product group is composed of two teams: Insights and Financial Empowerment. These teams are building products that solve meaningful problems for SMBs every day: giving them real-time insights into the health of their business, giving them close control and visibility into their books, and providing tools for making strategic business and financial decisions that help them save or make money.

Pilot’s aim is to provide our customers with the same superpowers as large companies with full finance teams — superpowers that include having a deep understanding of financial health of the business, the machinery to constantly improve it, and the predictive abilities to thoughtfully plan for the future. We do this at a fraction of the cost a large company would pay for this, by delivering these capabilities through powerful software.

Pilot’s backend is written in fully typed Python 3.11, and our frontend is JavaScript, TypeScript, and Vue.js. We use Terraform to manage our production infrastructure, and deploy Docker containers to ECS. AWS CodeDeploy powers our deployments and we rely on Honeycomb for our monitoring and Postgres as our database.

Key Responsibilities
• Building, testing and deploying software in a continuous manner (we deploy daily or more often)
• Working with PMs and Product Designers, and participating in product and design reviews.
• Creating and contributing to technical specs and testing/rollout plans.
• Working with internal customers and stakeholders to ensure we’re solving the right problems.
• Mentoring and sponsoring your teammates to help them grow.
• Supporting your software and services as required.

About You

Even if you don’t have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, we’d love to talk to you! Our requirements are:
• 5+ years of experience as a software engineer
• Experience with Python in production
• Able to work collaboratively across functions
• Strong written, verbal, and technical communication skills
• Able to write well-structured, well-tested, and maintainable code
• Demonstrated ability to mentor and teach others

Additionally, we’re interested in engineers with specialties or backgrounds in accounting as well as fintech and related fields.

About Pilot

Pilot launched in 2017 to bring the back office into the modern era. Pilot provides small businesses with dedicated finance experts - which Pilot hires as full-time, U.S.-based employees - who learn the ins-and-outs of their business. Pilot integrates directly with the billing, banking, expense, and payroll systems customers already use. With a special blend of custom software and expert bookkeepers, Pilot delivers accurate, consistent bookkeeping and financial management and tax services that give entrepreneurs the freedom to focus on their business.

Pilot has over 1,000 customers and has raised over $170 million in financing from Sequoia, Index Ventures, Stripe, Bezos Expeditions, and Whale Rock. Our investors also include a long list of world-class entrepreneurs, including Patrick and John Collison, Drew Houston, and Diane Greene. Our most recent funding round doubled our valuation to $1.2 billion – Meet Fintech’s Newest Unicorn.
Why Pilot?
• We invest in our employees’ development and happiness because our employees are the keys to our success and ensuring happy customers
• The opportunity to join a seasoned founding team that has led companies through two prior successful startups and acquisitions (by Oracle and Dropbox).
• Flexible vacation/time-off policy
• All federal holidays are observed
• Competitive benefits package including wellness benefits such as Modern Health, Headscape, One Medical, Aaptiv and Rightway
• Parental leave for birthing or non-birthing parents – 100% pay for 12 weeks
• 401(k) plan

The base pay range target for the role seniority described in this job description is $156,000 - $211,000 in San Francisco, CA. Final offer amounts depend on multiple factors such as candidate experience and expertise, geographic location, total compensation, and market data. In addition to cash pay, full-time regular positions are eligible for equity, 401(k), health benefits, and other benefits; some of these benefits may be available for part-time or temporary positions.

Pilot commits to provide a work environment free of discrimination and harassment, as well as equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.

About Column

For companies building financial technology and transforming the financial services space, the biggest bottleneck to their growth and innovation is often the underlying banks and infrastructure stack they rely on. We have spent our careers founding and scaling companies like Plaid, Square, SoFi, Blend, and Affirm, and have seen this problem firsthand — builders and developers needing to partner with traditional banks, and creating API and abstraction layers over the patchwork that is the bank, its core, and many other vendors.

All of this results in a complex (and often expensive) banking supply chain involving a user, fintech, BaaS middleware provider, bank, core and the Federal Reserve.

At Column, we set out to simplify and fix this. We are a bank and a software company built from the ground up, offering builders and developers technology-forward banking solutions that cut out the hundreds of vendors, middleware providers, and abstraction layers. This means a safer, more transparent, and less costly banking supply chain. Come build with us!

The opportunity

We’re a lean and experienced team. We like our current team size of nine engineers but we have a need for a talented Backend engineer to join us. We write mostly Go, but experience there isn’t that important (it’s a pretty easy language to learn). We generally prefer candidates with at least five years of production coding experience at a high-caliber and high-velocity team.

We’ll require a take-home that does take time, so if that’s a non-starter for you we’re sorry. We find it the best way for you to show your skills, without being overly burdensome on the team! This role is San Francisco based and you’ll be expected to work out of our (awesome) Presidio-based office 3+ days a week.

What you’ll need to be successful:
• Proven experience with a strongly typed back-end language, coupled with proficiency in SQL
• A track record of making independent product decisions and exhibiting strong self-management skills.
• Preferably, an interest and desire in the financial services/fintech industry is ideal, but not a requirement, as long as you have a desire to deeply learn our products and industry.

What you’ll get from us:
• Comprehensive health, dental, and vision plans, including options that are 100% covered by Column for you and 50% covered for your dependents
• FSA and HSA account options to enable use of pre-tax money for medical and dependent care expenses
• 401k plan, including self-directed brokerage options
• Flexible time-off policy - take the time off that you want and need to relax and recharge
• 100% paid parental leave
• Catered lunches and dinners for SF employees
• Commuter benefits
• Regular team building events, including annual offsite

Pay transparency

The annual US base salary range for this role is $130,000-$200,000.

This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Column, and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the candidate’s skill sets, experience, licensure and certifications, location, and other business and organizational needs. Posted salary ranges reflect base salary only, exclusive of equity and other compensation and benefits.
We

look forward to hearing from you

Column is committed to working with the best and brightest people from the broadest talent pool possible. We value bringing together a team with different perspectives, educational backgrounds, and life experiences, and believe a diversity of ideas is what allows us to develop the best solutions. All qualified individuals are encouraged to apply.
